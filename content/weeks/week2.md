I made a neuron vinyl cutout also!!
To do this I searched for sillhouette images of neurons and downloaded the image. I then imported it to Adobe Illustrator where I did outline as sillhouette such that I can modify parameters like the line thickness. This was important since I was miniaturizing the neuron sticker, I needed to make the lines thicker to print properly. Then uploading a png to the mods software was super user friendly. I gave a lot of my friends stickers!

For this week I started by designing a box with japanese wedge joints with a sliding top. I accidentally deleted the holes for the joints in one cut. I also realized that the corrugation to bend the cardboard needed to be spaced slightly further apart. Fusion had a seizure when I tried to move the small corrugation pattern because there are a lot of elements that are constrained and mirrored, so that remains TBD (to be done). Anyways I now have a nice box to store the cage cards from my experimental mice! 

Sadly, this week my cat at home was passing away. I decided to make a rocking seahorse toy for my cat, which arrived just in time.
