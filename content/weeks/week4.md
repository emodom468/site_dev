I first though about printing a snowglobe, but when text-to-cad failed to make a suitable object I moved on. I considered a microscope, a mechanical bic pencil, a bird whistle, and a lock-and-key. I searched for avialable cad files and happened upon this cool [link](https://woodgears.ca/combolock/index.html) of inspiration for printing a combination lock. If printed in one piece, I would say this is an object that cannot be made subtractively. However, this was printed piece by piece sorry! 

I printed a combination lock which I found avialable on [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/553644-five-digits-combination-padlockrecreated-6-9-digit). My lab has a formlabs 3+ model printer. I downloaded the stl files, checked them out in fusion 360, and prepared them for printing in the Preform software. We currently only have clear resin, so this is why my lock was printed in clear.

It turns out that this lock have benefited from a single object, no-assembly print. I am unable to fit all five of the rotary components into the lock.

While the clear resin was my first roadblock in the microscope idea, it could be useful for the snowglobe. I also plan to print a cover for my electronics with this. 

I also 3d printed an IR light holder for my rig (shoutout marcello). I was lazily taping the IR light to a post when Marcello decided to design this holder. After printing we noticed a small design flaw, so I went back to CAD and made the necessary modifications.

Oh yeah, one day I want to 3d print a tutu or make a costume out of the heat responsive polymers!
